# Gatsby

This directory is a brief example of a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

> **Note:** SSR, DSG, and API Routes [are now supported](https://vercel.com/changelog/improved-support-for-gatsby-sites). We do not currently support some Gatsby v5 features, including Partial Hydration and the Slice API.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Gatsby project, along with Serverless Functions, with Vercel.
